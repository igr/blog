  Object-Oriented Programming should focus on hiding data and exposing interactions, yet itâ€™s often missing the essence.
---

At its core, OOP should be about just two key principles:

+ **Hide Data**
+ **Reveal Interactions**

Thatâ€™s it. `HD,RI`.

Maybe itâ€™s just my two decades of missing the point, but I believe something is deeply wrong with how OOP is usually taught and understood today. And itâ€™s causing real, lasting damage to how we build software.

## Some Facts

ðŸ”¥ **Objects donâ€™t exist without interaction.**

This is a fundamental law of nature â€” and it applies to software too. You canâ€™t model an object without knowing how it interacts with the world around it. Yet, OOP books always start with isolated objects: a bicycle has gears and can be ridden, a person has a name and age, a dog can bark. But thatâ€™s the wrong approach. You canâ€™t design an object in isolation â€” you have to understand how itâ€™s used.

ðŸ”¥ **Interactions come first, behavior comes second.**

Behavior is a reaction to an interaction. Thatâ€™s why we should first think about interactions â€” only then can we figure out what behaviors we need, and what abstractions make sense for our system.

ðŸ”¥ **Data stays hidden inside objects.**

This point canâ€™t be emphasized enough. Even though most OOP theory talks about encapsulation, I rarely see it respected in practice. There should be no shared global state, no public getters or setters. Each object keeps its own private data â€” only what it needs to function.

ðŸ”¥ **Channels connect senders and receivers.**

Each object uses specific channels to communicate. Every pair of communicating objects has its own channel. A channel acts as an interface: it defines the name of the message and the data being passed. Messages are implemented as methods within the receiving object.

ðŸ”¥ **Messages are signals.**

A message is a signal to the receiver: "Hey, do something" or "Hey, something happened." The message includes data the receiver actually needs â€” not whatever the sender happens to have lying around.

ðŸ”¥ **Objects are not shared.**

You donâ€™t send objects in messages â€” you send data. You donâ€™t inject one object into another â€” you connect them with a communication channel. Objects are isolated and self-contained.

## Example in Java

Here's a simple scenario:

> Corgis run around a rectangular garden, moving one cell at a time without crossing the boundaries. They start with some energy, which decreases when they enter a cell occupied by other Corgis. When their energy reaches zero, they fall asleep and are removed. Each move prints the Corgiâ€™s name and new position.
