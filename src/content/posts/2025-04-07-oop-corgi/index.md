  Object-Oriented Programming should focus on hiding data and exposing interactions, yet itâ€™s often missing the essence.
---

At its core, OOP should be about just two key principles:

+ **Hide Data**
+ **Expose Interactions**

Thatâ€™s it.

Maybe itâ€™s just my two decades of missing the point, but I believe something is deeply wrong with how OOP is usually taught and understood today. And itâ€™s causing real, lasting damage to how we build software.

## Some Facts

ðŸ”¥ **Objects donâ€™t exist without interaction.**

This is a fundamental law of natureâ€”and it applies to software too. You canâ€™t model an object without knowing how it interacts with the world around it. Yet, OOP books always start with isolated objects: a bicycle has gears and can be ridden, a person has a name and age, a dog can bark. But thatâ€™s the wrong approach. You canâ€™t design an object in isolation â€” you have to understand how itâ€™s used.

ðŸ”¥ **Prioritize interactions over behavior.**

Behavior is a response to interaction. This principle reflects the fundamental nature of systems, where interactions between components or entities drive the behaviors that follow. Thatâ€™s why we should first focus on interactionsâ€”only then can we determine the necessary behaviors and design abstractions that fit the system.

ðŸ”¥ **Data stays hidden inside objects.**

This point canâ€™t be emphasized enough. Even though OOP theory talks about data encapsulation, I rarely see it respected in practice. There should be no shared global state, no public getters or setters. Each object keeps its own private data â€” only what it needs to operate.

ðŸ”¥ **Channels connect senders and receivers.**

In the context of OOP, the concept of channels can be thought of as a metaphor for how objects communicate with each other. Each pair of objects that need to interact should have their own unique channel. A channel acts like an interface or a contract between two objects. It defines the message name and the data being passed. Messages are implemented as methods within the receiving object.

ðŸ”¥ **Messages are signals.**

A message is a signal to the receiver: "Hey, do something" or "Hey, something happened." The message includes data the receiver actually needs â€” not whatever the sender happens to have lying around.

ðŸ”¥ **Objects are not shared.**

In OOP, the principle of object isolation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and independence of objects. When objects communicate, they should exchange data rather than references to other objects. You donâ€™t inject one object into another â€” you connect them with a communication channel. Objects are isolated and self-contained.

## Example in Java

Here's a simple scenario:

> Corgis run around a rectangular garden, moving one cell at a time without crossing the boundaries. They start with some energy, which decreases when they enter a cell occupied by other Corgis. When their energy reaches zero, they fall asleep and are removed. Each move prints the Corgiâ€™s name and new position.
