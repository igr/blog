title: TDD has no significant value.
---

TDD is a method of gradually incrementing software functionality toward a desired outcome. The incremental progress is driven by tests, followed by refactoring. TDD emphasizes minimal increments, which promise a _self-emerging_ design. However, this approach can only lead to finding a local maximumâ€”there is no guarantee of reaching the optimal solution. There is _no evidence_ of any observable benefits from practicing TDD. Furthermore, software engineers should already write tests and perform refactoring as part of their daily practice, without needing a formal methodology to enforce these habits.
