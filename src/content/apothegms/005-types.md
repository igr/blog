title: Distinguish between "type" terms.
---

The term "type" is overloaded, encompassing several distinct meanings. 1) _Machine type_ describes the primitive storage format of a value. 2) _(Algebraic) data type_ is a composite of other types, typically represented as product types (e.g., records) or sum types. Finally, 3) _Behavior type_ describes a state along with operations on that state, often incorrectly implemented as classes.
