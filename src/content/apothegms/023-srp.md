title: SRP is vague, avoid it.
---

The Single Responsibility Principle claims that a class should have only one reason to change. However, it conflates vague concepts like "responsibility" and "reason for change," creating more confusion than clarity. Rooted in misinterpretations of David Parnasâ€™ ideas on modularization and system decomposition, SRP oversimplifies complex principles and misguides developers with its binary application, offering an unhelpful abstraction that sacrifices precision.
