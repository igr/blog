title: "I don't know."
---

A common myth in software engineering is that experience equates to always having immediate answers. This belief is neither accurate nor realistic. Experience does not eliminate uncertainty; rather, it shortens the path to finding solutions. Acknowledging "I donâ€™t know" fosters a culture of continuous learning, self-reflection, adaptability, and improvement.

Learn. Refactor. Repeat.
