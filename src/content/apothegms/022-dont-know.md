title: "I don't know."

A common myth in software engineering is that experience equates to always having immediate answers.
This belief is neither accurate nor realistic.
Experience does not eliminate uncertainty; rather, it shortens the path to solutions.

Learn. Rethink. Refactor. Repeat until you have enough answers. Then act.
